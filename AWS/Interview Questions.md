When I try to launch an ec2 instance i am getting Service limit exceed, how to fix the 
issue?
I need to modify the ebs volumes in Linux and windows is it possible?
I am viewing an AWS Console but unable to launch the instance, I receive an IAM Error 
how can I rectify it?
I don’t want my AWS Account id to be exposed to users how can I avoid it?
You have launched a Linux instance in AWS EC2. While configuring security group, you  
Have selected SSH, HTTP, HTTPS protocol. Why do we need to select SSH?
You have an EC2 instance that has an unencrypted volume. You want to create another  
Encrypted volume from this unencrypted volume. Which of the following steps can achieve 
this?
If I am running on my DB Instance a Multi-AZ deployments, can I use to the stand by the 
DB Instance for read or write a operation along with to primary DB instance?
Which the AWS services will you use to the collect and the process e-commerce data for 
the near by real-time analysis?
Your application has to the retrieve on data from your user’s mobile take every 5 minutes 
and then data is stored in the DynamoDB, later every day at the particular time the data is an 
extracted into S3 on a per user basis and then your application is later on used to visualize the 
data to user. You are the asked to the optimize the architecture of the backend system can to 
lower cost, what would you recommend do?
You are running to website on EC2 instances can deployed across multiple Availability 
Zones with an Multi-AZ RDS MySQL Extra Large DB Instance etc. Then site performs a high 
number of the small reads and the write per second and the relies on the eventual consistency 
model. After the comprehensive tests you discover to that there is read contention on RDS 
MySQL. Which is the best approaches to the meet these requirements?
An startup is running to a pilot deployment of around 100 sensors to the measure street 
noise and The air quality is urban areas for the 3 months. It was noted that every month to 
around the 4GB of sensor data are generated. The company uses to a load balanced take auto 
scaled layer of the EC2 instances and a RDS database with a 500 GB standard storage. The pilot 
was success and now they want to the deploy take atleast 100K sensors.let which to need the 
supported by backend. You need to the stored data for at least 2 years to an analyze it. Which 
setup of  following would you be prefer?
You have an the EC2 Security Group with a several running to EC2 instances. You 
changed to the Security of Group rules to allow the inbound traffic on a new port and protocol, 
and then the launched a several new instances in the same of Security Group.Such the new rules 
apply?
An customers wants to the captures all client connections to get information from his load 
balancers at an interval of 5 minutes only, which cal select option  should he choose for his 
application?
s a company needs to monitor a read and write IOPS for the AWS MySQL RDS 
instances and then send real-time alerts to the operations of team. Which AWS services to can 
accomplish this?
You use the Amazon CloudWatch as your primary monitoring system for 
web application. After a recent to software deployment, your users are to getting  
Intermittent the 500 Internal Server to the Errors, when you using web application. You want 
to create the CloudWatch alarm, and notify the on-call engineer let when these occur. How can 
you accomplish the using the AWS services?
You are designing a multi-platform of web application for the AWS. The application will 
run on the EC2 instances and Till will be accessed from PCs, tablets and smart phones.Then 
Supported accessing a platforms are Windows, MACOS, IOS and Android. They Separate 
sticky sessions and SSL certificate took setups are required for the different platform types. 
Which do describes the most cost effective and Like performance efficient the architecture 
setup?
